RSBAC README-nrlists
--------------------

For large systems (very many files per partition) you should increase
RSBAC_NR_FD_LISTS in include/rsbac/aci_data_structures.h before compiling.

You should earnestly consider increasing, if you get warning messages like
"write_fd_list(): list n too large (m bytes), calling partial_write_fd_list()!"
(this does not lead to data loss though - it only decreases stability a
bit). This should not happen any longer though - if it does, please send a
note to RSBAC mailing list containing your /proc/rsbac-info/stats output and
the output of free at the time when the messages appear for examination.

CAUTION:
- When restarting with a larger number of lists for the first time, you *must*
  use the kernel parameter rsbac_change_nr! Only then old attributes are
  allowed to be sorted into the now correct lists, otherwise they get lost and
  that's it.
- Please remember mounting rw all partitions used by RSBAC so far, while
  rsbac_change_nr is still active.
- There is definately no way back to a smaller number. All following RSBAC
  versions must be set to the same value, and rebooting with an older kernel
  can result in unnoticable attribute losses.

To test this feature, you can use rsbac_debug_no_write. This prevents
attribute saving and thus attribute loss from previous runs. Those
partitions that are not mounted rw at boot time can be tested by mounting
read-only.
