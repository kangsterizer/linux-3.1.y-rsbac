Credits for many patches showing bugs and possible fixes and lots of good
ideas go to many people. We cannot recall them all so only a few are included
here, if you are missing let us know :)

  - 'Our Russian RSBAC Team',
  - AltLinux with their AltLinux Castle distribution.
  - Adamantix
  - rtp, addobie, and the people from #rsbac[-dev]

Also, there are several people doing lots of helpful promotion, too many to
name them here. Their part cannot be rated too low.

The RSBAC team.
