RSBAC README for patching against other versions.
-------------------------------------------------

To make my point clear: I do not recommend patching against other kernel
versions than stated in the patch filename. Rather check RSBAC homepage
for new versions or send a note to the RSBAC mailing list (see README).

If you had to patch against another version, you will have to do the following:
 - Make sure you understand how rsbac_adf_request() and rsbac_adf_set_attr()
   calls work
 - Patch in all rejects by hand.
 - Edit fs/namei.c:
     rsbac_lookup_one_len/hash must be lookup_one_len/hash minus
     checks (permission(), rsbac_adf_request()).
     Please do not forget to change the call to lookup_hash in
     rsbac_lookup_one_len into rsbac_lookup_hash.
 - arch/i386/kernel/entry.S must contain the RSBAC syscall number added,
   embraced by #ifdef CONFIG_RSBAC.
   You may have to adjust syscall numbers there and in
   include/rsbac/unistd-i386.h. After that make sure you recompiled the
   admin tools.
 - Same for all other archs
 - Check in rsbac/data_structures/aci_data_structures.c, if file opening and
   closing are done correctly (rsbac_read_open, rsbac_write_open,
   rsbac_read_close, rsbac_write_close).
 - Check in rsbac/help/debug.c, whether the logging in rsbac_log() is
   implemented correctly - see sys_syslog() in kernel/printk.c
