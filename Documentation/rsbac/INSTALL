RSBAC INSTALL
=============

Installation from a RSBAC tarball
---------------------------------

You probably already untar'ed the rsbac-x.y.z.tar.gz archive. You can safely
untar this archive into your kernel main directory, or copy all files there
- no file should be overwritten.

To get RSBAC working, you must then patch the kernel using an RSBAC kernel
patch patch-x.y.z-va.b.c.bz2, matching your kernel version. In kernel main dir
call
bzip2 -dc patch-x.y.z-va.b.c.bz2 | patch -p1 &>perr
After patching, everything should be in place and a log should be in perr.

If your kernel version is not supported, check at
<http://www.rsbac.org/download> for newer patch files.
