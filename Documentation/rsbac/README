Describes the various kernel parameters that can be used with RSBAC.

README-proc:
Describes the proc interface to RSBAC.

Information about the registration of additional RSBAC decision modules
(option CONFIG_RSBAC_REG) can be found in README-reg and html/reg.htm.

(Quite old) man pages for many RSBAC syscalls are in the man directory.
Russian versions can be found in man-rus.

README-nrlists:
For large systems (very many files per partition) you might consider
increasing RSBAC_NR_FD_LISTS in include/rsbac/aci_data_structures.h before
compiling. Please read README-nrlists first.
There is also now a kernel configuration option.

README-patching:
If you patched against another kernel version than stated in the patch
filename, it is important to work through README-patching.

README-reg:
Information about the registration of additional RSBAC decision modules
(option CONFIG_RSBAC_REG) can be found in README-reg.
